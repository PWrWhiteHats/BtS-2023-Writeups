Both the MinuteMazurka.mp4 and Chopin’s photo have an additional EXIF tag called
Software that can be easily seen using exiftool with some text:

```
There is no substitute for this Mazurka. I have listened to it at least 4 times.

AkRZKK{KU3U3U1Z_ZM0A1A_M4R_M_K1AAKR_MU_KA0}
```

The first text hints to a possible substitution cipher. By using the word “Mazurka” 4 times as
a substitution for the alphabet the flag is deciphered:

**BtSCTF{FR3D3R1C_CH0P1N_H4S_A_M1NUTE_OR_TW0}**
