    Jeff recently bought this new social media platform. And now he thinks he is now Almighty God,
    posting even more and making his posts more visible than others. It seems ... a little unfair, doesn't it?

    He also thinks this platform is superior to any other, also in terms of security. Let's see if we can prove him wrong, shall we?

    Log in as fake Jeff Kowalski with username "kowalski" and password "12345" and
    post on another user's timeline the message "I_HAVE_PWNED_THIS_PLATFORM".

    After you've compromised another user's timeline,
    refresh the whole website to get a gift.
